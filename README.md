# SharedDeliveryCost-CSE201Project
 
The SharedDeliveryCost web application will allow users to get connected with other users in order to make a group delivery from a company, by that decreasing the delivery costs they need to pay.

The application allows you to:
1. Register and log in as a user. Giving the following information:
	- email address (used for log in and future contacting)
	- password
	- Name and Surname (username)
	- Default location
2. Make an order by giving the following informations:
	- company the user wants to order from (ex. Ikea)
	- amount of his order
	- how much he is willing to pay for the shipping cost
	- location (if different from him default one)
	- distance willing to go to pick up his order (ex. None- for big objects, 500m for something small)
3. Recieve a notification when their order has been grouped. This contains:
	- The contact information of the people you were grouped in order share your delivery
	- The portion of the delivery you are going to pay
	- A valid address for the delivery taking into account the "locations" and "willingness to go" from all included parties
